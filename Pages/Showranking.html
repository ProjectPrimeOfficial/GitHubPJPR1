<body>
    <h1> Best Shows I Ever Watched </h1>
    <h2> These are the ranking of my favorite and a bit of insight into why I think they are so god, in order to build some hype I decided to do this in descending order starting from 5 to number 1 </h2>
    <ol reversed start="5">
        <li> <h3> YOU </h3> 
        <Img src="../Images/you.jpg" />
        <p> The Protagonist and villain of the show was deeply complex, I enjoyed the guilt and denial phase of season 4 but ultimately the character gave in to thier dark impluses and paid the price. </p>

        <br/>
        <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80211991"> Let me know what you think </a>
    </li> 
     <li> <h3> Bleach </h3>
        <img src="../Images/bleach.jpg" alt="image of bleach ">
        <p> One of my favourite anime shows ever, I have rewatched it twice as well as read the manga twice. Alongside Fairytail and Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach took first place because I enjoyed both the manga and anime more </p>
    </li>
    <li> <h3> The Boys </h3>
    <img src="../Images/tb2.jpg" alt="The boys">
    <p> Enjoyed this absolute masterpiece during a very difficult time in my life, rewatched it 3 times now. It's amazing with an amzing villain. I really enjoyed hughie's character and growth. </p>

    <li> <h3> The Walking Dead (S1 to S8 Only) </h3>
        <img src="../Images/twdfinal.jpg" alt="my mercy">
        <p> Tempted as I was to make this Arcane, 'My mercy prevails over my wrath'</p>
